# PyGL-RobotSimulator
By Luuk van Oijen, just use it. It's open source hell yeah!

# What the **** is this?
This is made in python, standard libraries (using ctypes for opengl support), to simulate a robot arm. It might get changed into a 3D engine for more, depending on the performance I can get, or if the project (the robot arm) gets canceled. I didnt fully make the OpenGL functions etc, since I found the code for that on a website (https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1073475/OpenGL-in-Python-with-TKinter). I removed the linux support for now, since I have my laptop with Linux and Windows 8.1 on dualboot, but it might come later.

It's open source, although credit for the original code (and everything that I upload here, including updates and models) and don't spread this as your work, if you didn't change a lot. If you have any questions, just contact me on Discord: lucky4luuk#5979
